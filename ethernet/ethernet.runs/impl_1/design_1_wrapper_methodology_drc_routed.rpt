TIMING-2#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock source pin  
A primary clock design_1_i/axi_ethernetlite_0/U0/phy_rx_clk is created on an inappropriate pin design_1_i/axi_ethernetlite_0/U0/phy_rx_clk. It is recommended to create a primary clock only on a proper clock source (input port or primitive output pin with no timing arc)
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-2#2 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock source pin  
A primary clock design_1_i/axi_ethernetlite_0/U0/phy_tx_clk is created on an inappropriate pin design_1_i/axi_ethernetlite_0/U0/phy_tx_clk. It is recommended to create a primary clock only on a proper clock source (input port or primitive output pin with no timing arc)
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock design_1_i/axi_ethernetlite_0/U0/phy_rx_clk is defined downstream of clock clk_out3_design_1_clk_wiz_1_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#2 Critical Warning

There is a large setup violation of -4.104 ns between design_1_i/ip_top_level_0/inst/dut/my_solver/my_solver/stage_reg[0]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and design_1_i/ip_top_level_0/inst/dut/my_solver/my_solver/cache_reg[0][4][15]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-to : [get_pins -hier -include_replicated_objects -filter {NAME =~ *temp_mon_enabled.u_tempmon/device_temp_sync_r1_reg[*]/D}]' of constraint 'set_max_delay' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '22' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].
